# Updater Release Runbook

This runbook describes how to publish an updater-compatible Ovid release with the current
repository setup.

It assumes:

- GitHub Releases hosts the versioned release artifacts
- GitHub Pages hosts the stable updater metadata file at `latest.json`
- macOS and Windows are the only updater targets in scope for now
- Windows release assets come from GitHub Actions
- macOS release assets are built locally on a Mac and published with one local automation command

## One-Time Setup

### 1. Generate the updater signing keypair

Generate one persistent Tauri updater signing keypair outside the repository.

Keep:

- the public key for app configuration
- the private key for CI signing only

Do not rotate this key casually. Existing installs rely on the same public key to verify
future releases.

### 2. Store the private key in GitHub Actions secrets

Add these repository or environment secrets in GitHub:

- `TAURI_UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `TAURI_UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`

Do not commit the private key into the repo and do not upload it as a workflow artifact.

### 3. Commit the public key in Tauri config

The updater public key and endpoint live in
[src-tauri/tauri.conf.json](../src-tauri/tauri.conf.json).

Before the first updater-capable release, verify:

- `plugins.updater.endpoints` points at `https://hutusi.github.io/ovid/latest.json`
- `plugins.updater.pubkey` matches the public key generated from your persistent keypair
- `plugins.updater.pubkey` stores the base64-encoded content of the `.pub` file, not the raw
  multi-line minisign text

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages

The metadata workflow publishes `latest.json` to GitHub Pages.

Verify the repository Pages configuration allows GitHub Actions to deploy Pages content, and
confirm the expected final URL:

- `https://hutusi.github.io/ovid/latest.json`

## Per-Release Steps

### 1. Prepare the release version

Before tagging the release:

- update the version in `package.json`
- update the version in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- update the version in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- update `CHANGELOG.md`
- for Windows MSI targets, avoid semver labels like `-rc1` or `-beta.1`; use a plain `x.y.z`
  version or a Windows-compatible numeric prerelease identifier if you intentionally need one

Run the normal release validation:

```bash
bun run validate
```

### 2. Create and push the version tag

Create the release tag in the `vX.Y.Z` format expected by
[.github/workflows/release-bundles.yml](../.github/workflows/release-bundles.yml).

Example:

```bash
git tag v0.9.3
git push origin v0.9.3
```

That workflow will:

- build the Windows MSI bundle
- enable updater artifact generation if `TAURI_UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY` is present
- attach the generated Windows release bundles to the GitHub release

### 3. Run the local macOS release automation

After the workflow completes, verify the GitHub release for the new version contains the Windows
artifacts you need for updater metadata:

- `Ovid_<version>_x64_en-US.msi`
- `Ovid_<version>_x64_en-US.msi.sig`

Then run the local macOS release command on your Mac:

```bash
bun run release:macos-local -- --version <version>
```

That command will:

- build the macOS DMG and updater tarball locally
- upload the macOS artifacts to the existing GitHub release
- download the Windows MSI signature from the release
- trigger the `Updater Metadata` workflow with the final Windows and macOS values

Equivalent explicit example:

```bash
bun run release:macos-local -- --version 0.9.6 --clobber
```

Prerelease example:

```bash
bun run release:macos-local -- --version 0.9.8
```

The command expects:

- the matching `v<version>` tag and GitHub release to already exist
- the Windows CI release job to have completed successfully
- `gh` to be authenticated locally

If Windows assets are missing, the command fails instead of guessing release metadata.

### 4. Verify the published metadata

After the local automation command completes, verify:

- `https://hutusi.github.io/ovid/latest.json` is reachable
- the JSON version matches the release version
- the platform URLs point to the correct GitHub release assets
- the platform signatures are populated

### 5. Smoke-test update behavior

Before treating the release as updater-ready, test on real installs:

- macOS install on a version older than the new release
- Windows install on a version older than the new release

Check:

- the app can fetch update metadata
- the offered version matches the release
- the update flow points to the correct platform artifact
- signature verification does not fail

## Failure Cases

### Release workflow builds bundles but no updater artifacts

Likely cause:

- `TAURI_UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY` or `TAURI_UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` is missing in GitHub
  Actions secrets

### Windows assets are published but macOS assets are missing

Likely causes:

- the local automation command has not been run yet
- the local macOS build did not include `createUpdaterArtifacts`, so `Ovid.app.tar.gz.sig`
  was not generated
- the upload step failed before the release assets were attached

### Downloaded macOS DMG shows as broken even though checksums match

Likely causes:

- the downloaded DMG and the copied app are still subject to Gatekeeper checks because the app is
  not yet Developer ID signed and notarized
- quarantine removal may need to be applied to both the downloaded DMG and the copied
  `/Applications/Ovid.app` during limited internal testing

Notes:

- this is an internal-test workaround only, not a public release instruction
- the real fix is Apple signing and notarization, tracked in GitHub issue `#43`

### Windows MSI bundling fails on the app version

Likely cause:

- the app version uses a prerelease label such as `0.9.7-rc1`, but the MSI target only accepts a
  numeric prerelease identifier and will reject those labels during bundling

### `latest.json` publishes but updates do not work

Likely causes:

- the public key in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` does not match the signing private key used in
  CI
- the public key was committed in raw minisign text form instead of the base64-encoded `.pub`
  content that Tauri expects
- the metadata points at the wrong asset URL
- the metadata contains the wrong signature for one platform

### The local macOS automation command fails before metadata publish

Likely causes:

- the `v<version>` Git tag or GitHub release does not exist yet
- the Windows CI release job has not attached the MSI assets yet
- `gh` is not authenticated locally
- the release already contains macOS assets and the command needs `--clobber`

### GitHub Pages deploy succeeds but the URL is stale or missing

Likely causes:

- Pages is not configured to use GitHub Actions as the source
- the Pages deployment is still propagating
