# Updater Plan

This document defines the first implementation slice for Ovid application updates after
`0.9.0`.

The goal is to make updates trustworthy before they become automatic.

## Current State

As of `0.9.0`, Ovid has:

- native packaged artifacts for macOS (`.dmg`) and Windows (`.msi`)
- a GitHub-based release flow
- a GitHub Actions workflow for building the Windows MSI

Ovid does **not** yet have:

- the Tauri updater plugin configured
- updater signing keys in place
- updater metadata generation or hosting
- an in-app update check or install flow

## Ovid Repo Audit

Verified in the current repo:

- [src-tauri/tauri.conf.json](../src-tauri/tauri.conf.json) has no updater plugin configuration
- [package.json](../package.json) has no `@tauri-apps/plugin-updater` dependency
- [src-tauri/Cargo.toml](../src-tauri/Cargo.toml) has no `tauri-plugin-updater` dependency
- [src-tauri/src/lib.rs](../src-tauri/src/lib.rs) currently initializes `opener` and `dialog` plugins only
- [src-tauri/capabilities/default.json](../src-tauri/capabilities/default.json) has no updater-related permission entry
- [src-tauri/src/lib.rs](../src-tauri/src/lib.rs) already has a native `Help` menu, which is the right future home for `Check for Updates`

This means Ovid is not one config flag away from updater support. The release pipeline,
desktop permissions, Rust plugin setup, and frontend surface all still need explicit work.

## Product Decision

Updater work should ship in this order:

1. release pipeline readiness
2. manual update check
3. manual update install
4. automatic background check

Do not start with silent or background auto-installation.

## Why This Order

- The updater depends on release metadata and signature discipline, not just app UI.
- A visible manual flow is easier to test and debug on macOS and Windows.
- Early updater failures damage user trust more than most normal feature bugs.

## Ovid-Specific UX Plan

### Entry Points

- Add `Check for Updates` to the native `Help` menu.
- Later, expose updater settings in preferences once background checks exist.

### Manual Update Check

The first in-app updater UI should show:

- current app version
- latest available version
- release notes summary or release link
- explicit `Up to date` state
- explicit offline/error state

### Manual Install Flow

The app should:

- download only after explicit user intent
- show platform-appropriate status and failure messages
- avoid blocking the editor until installation is actually required

### Automatic Checks

After the manual flow is stable:

- check on launch or at a calm interval
- notify instead of forcing install
- allow the user to defer

## Release Pipeline Requirements

Before runtime updater code is added, the release pipeline must support:

- signed updater artifacts
- stable release metadata per platform
- a reliable endpoint for updater JSON
- consistent asset naming and publishing

For Ovid, that likely means:

- GitHub Releases remain the distribution source
- updater metadata is generated as part of release publishing
- macOS and Windows updater artifacts are published together for each version

## Tauri 2 Requirements

The current Tauri 2 updater model requires:

- updater plugin setup in both Rust and frontend
- updater endpoints in Tauri config
- updater public key (`pubkey`) in Tauri config
- updater artifacts enabled in bundling

Relevant official docs:

- https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/

Important implications:

- signatures are required; updater verification is not optional
- release assets alone are not enough; metadata must also be published
- updater behavior is platform-sensitive and must be tested on macOS and Windows

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 12.70 — Updater Release Pipeline

Deliverables:

- choose metadata hosting approach
- generate persistent updater signing keys
- enable updater artifact generation
- document release publishing steps for updater-compatible releases

Concrete repo checklist:

- add updater dependencies to [package.json](../package.json) and [src-tauri/Cargo.toml](../src-tauri/Cargo.toml)
- add updater plugin initialization in [src-tauri/src/lib.rs](../src-tauri/src/lib.rs)
- add updater config and `createUpdaterArtifacts` in [src-tauri/tauri.conf.json](../src-tauri/tauri.conf.json)
- update [src-tauri/capabilities/default.json](../src-tauri/capabilities/default.json) with updater permissions once the plugin is installed
- define how updater metadata is published alongside GitHub releases
- define where the updater signing private key is stored in CI and who owns rotation

Exit criteria:

- a release can publish all updater inputs without manual guesswork

### Phase 12.71 — Manual Update Check

Deliverables:

- `Check for Updates` menu action
- update query wiring
- modal or dialog for update state

Exit criteria:

- users can reliably tell whether a newer version exists

### Phase 12.72 — Manual Update Install

Deliverables:

- user-initiated download/install flow
- clear progress and failure handling

Exit criteria:

- a user can upgrade from inside Ovid without visiting GitHub manually

### Phase 12.73+ — Automatic Update Behavior

Deliverables:

- background check timing
- update preferences
- resilience for offline and partial-failure cases

Exit criteria:

- background checks are helpful and non-disruptive

## Open Decisions

- Whether updater metadata should be committed to the repo, published by CI, or stored in a
  separate release bucket
- Whether the first updater-supported macOS release should use the existing DMG path or a
  different updater-compatible artifact path
- Whether Windows install mode should stay conservative (`passive`) for the first updater
  release
- Whether Ovid should use GitHub Releases directly as the updater metadata endpoint or publish
  a dedicated stable `latest.json` URL outside GitHub's release UI

## Recommendation

Start with Phase `12.70` only.

Do not add updater UI or plugin runtime code until the release pipeline, metadata strategy,
and signing key handling are all defined clearly enough to test end-to-end.

## Recommended Hosting Model

Use a split hosting model:

- **GitHub Releases** for versioned updater artifacts
- **GitHub Pages** for a stable updater metadata URL such as `latest.json`

### Why This Split

- GitHub Releases is already Ovid's distribution channel for signed versioned assets.
- The updater needs a stable metadata endpoint that does not change every release.
- A stable `latest.json` URL behaves like an API surface, which is a better fit for updater
  configuration than a versioned release asset URL.

### Recommended Ovid Shape

- release artifacts stay attached to each GitHub release
- CI publishes a stable metadata file such as:
  - `https://hutusi.github.io/ovid/latest.json`
- that metadata points to GitHub Release asset URLs for the current version
- the repo can generate this file with [scripts/generate-updater-json.mjs](../scripts/generate-updater-json.mjs)
  and publish it with [.github/workflows/updater-metadata.yml](../.github/workflows/updater-metadata.yml)

### Metadata Contract

The current scaffold expects a static JSON payload shaped like:

```json
{
  "version": "0.9.1",
  "notes": "Release notes text",
  "pub_date": "2026-04-15T12:00:00Z",
  "platforms": {
    "windows-x86_64": {
      "signature": "WINDOWS_SIGNATURE",
      "url": "https://github.com/hutusi/ovid/releases/download/v0.9.1/..."
    },
    "darwin-aarch64": {
      "signature": "MAC_SIGNATURE",
      "url": "https://github.com/hutusi/ovid/releases/download/v0.9.1/..."
    }
  }
}
```

For Ovid, that means the release pipeline must eventually produce, for each supported
platform:

- an updater-compatible downloadable artifact URL
- the corresponding signature content
- a version string
- a publish timestamp
- a short notes payload

### Workflow Contract

The current metadata publishing workflow is intentionally manual first. It expects:

- `version`
- `pub_date`
- `notes`
- `windows_url`
- `windows_signature`
- `darwin_aarch64_url`
- `darwin_aarch64_signature`

That contract is deliberate:

- today, Ovid does not yet generate updater artifacts automatically
- later, the release workflow can supply these values directly once updater bundling is enabled
- until then, the metadata workflow remains a safe standalone building block instead of pretending
  the full updater pipeline already exists

### Avoid

- manually editing and committing `latest.json` for every release
- treating the GitHub release page structure as the updater API
- storing updater private signing keys in the repository
