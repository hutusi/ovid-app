 *
 * The four invariants this hook enforces:
 * - opening a file always selects it, pushes it to recents, and opens its tab
 * - renaming a file updates its tab, its recents entry, and the selection
 *   (if it was the active file) in lockstep
 * - removing a file closes its tab, drops its recents entry, and closes the
 *   editor if it was the active file
 * - closing the active file advances to a neighbour tab when there is one
 *
 * `useWorkspace.handleRename`/`handleDelete` no longer need to know about
 * tabs, recents, or selection — they call `notifyPathRenamed` /
 * `notifyPathRemoved` and the session updates everything coherently.
