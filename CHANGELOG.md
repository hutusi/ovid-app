release cadence and Conventional Commit history.

## Unreleased

### Post-release
- Follow-up work is now focused on stabilization, distribution hardening, and the remaining
  infrastructure gaps before `1.0.0`.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Keyboard-first workspace and file navigation with workspace switcher, file switcher, and
  full-text search.
- Markdown editing with frontmatter-aware properties, Typora-style rich editing, code blocks,
  tables, images, links, footnotes, and structural editing behavior.
- Amytis-oriented content workflows including content types, draft/publish handling, and
  writing-focused workspace behavior.
- Built-in Git workflow support for status, commit, branch switching, fetch, pull, push, and
  remote actions.
- In-app manual update checks and updater infrastructure for signed release bundles, stable
  `latest.json` publishing, and end-to-end Windows plus local macOS release operations.

### Changed
- Improved release and packaging workflows with Windows CI publishing, local macOS automation,
  bundled app branding, and clearer release operator documentation.
- Refined the desktop app presentation with the first Ovid app logo and regenerated packaged
  icon set.
- Continued stabilization and performance work across workspace opening, sidebar loading, search,
  editing, and save flows.

### Known Limits
- macOS public distribution is still limited by the missing Apple signing and notarization work.
- Some release and updater steps are still optimized for careful operator-driven publishing rather
  than fully automated public distribution.

### Added
- Keyboard-first workspace and file navigation with workspace switcher, file switcher, and
  full-text search.
- Markdown editing with frontmatter-aware properties, Typora-style rich editing, code blocks,
  tables, images, links, footnotes, and structural editing behavior.
- Amytis-oriented content workflows including content types, draft/publish handling, and
