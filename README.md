# Ovid App

A minimalist desktop editor for [Amytis](https://github.com/hutusi/amytis) content workspaces. Purpose-built for content creators who want a calm, keyboard-first writing environment without leaving their workspace.

Built with **Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript**, using **Bun** as the package manager.

---

## Requirements

- macOS, Windows, or Linux
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) — package manager and test runner
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) — required to build the Tauri backend
- `git` on `PATH` — optional; enables git status indicators and commit/push

---

## Installation & Development

```bash
bun install           # Install dependencies
bun run tauri dev     # Start with hot reload
bun run tauri build   # Build distributable app
bun run validate      # Type-check + lint + test
```

## Workspaces

### Opening a workspace

Click **Open folder** or press `Cmd+O` to pick a directory. Ovid walks the file tree and detects whether it is an Amytis workspace by checking for `site.config.ts` + `content/` directory. If the folder is not recognised as an Amytis project, a warning toast is shown.

Only `.md` and `.mdx` files appear in the sidebar.

### Auto-reopen

Ovid remembers the last workspace you had open and reopens it automatically on next launch. To suppress this, close the workspace and relaunch — the auto-reopen is skipped once a session starts without a workspace.

### Switching workspaces

Press `Cmd+Shift+O` or click the workspace name in the sidebar header to open the **Workspace Switcher**. It lists your five most recently opened workspaces. Select one to switch, or click **Open folder…** to pick a new directory.

---

## The Sidebar

The sidebar shows the full file tree of the current workspace, filtered to `.md` / `.mdx` files.

- **Toggle** — `Cmd+\` hides/shows the sidebar; state is remembered across sessions
- **Directory expand/collapse** — click a directory name or chevron to toggle; expanded state is persisted per workspace
- **Titles** — frontmatter `title` is shown instead of the filename where available
- **Draft indicator** — files with `draft: true` are dimmed
- **Git status** — per-file `●` (modified), `+` (untracked), `S` (staged) markers appear when the workspace is a git repository
- **Workspace name** — click it to open the workspace switcher

---

## File Management

### New file (`Cmd+N`)

Creates a new `.md` file. You are prompted for a filename. In an Amytis workspace with content types defined, you can also pick a content type — frontmatter fields are pre-filled accordingly. The file opens immediately in the editor.

### Rename (`F2` or double-click filename)

Inline rename in the sidebar. The editor tab updates automatically if the renamed file is currently open. Duplicate names are rejected.

### Delete (right-click → Delete)

Moves the file to the system Trash (not permanent delete). A confirmation dialog is shown. If the file is currently open, it is closed first.

### New folder

Right-click any directory in the sidebar and choose **New folder** to create a subdirectory. Useful for organising Amytis content collections.

---

## The Editor

Ovid uses a **Typora-style WYSIWYG** editor (Tiptap / ProseMirror). Markdown renders inline as you type — no split pane. Files are persisted as valid Markdown; `.md` and `.mdx` files are both supported and never coerced into a different format.

### Font & size

Click **Aa** in the status bar to open the editor settings popover:

- **Font** — Serif (Georgia), Sans (system-ui), or Mono (Fira Code / JetBrains Mono)
- **Size** — Small (15 px), Default (17 px), Large (19 px)

Preferences are persisted across sessions.

### Spell check

Toggle native OS spell check from the **Aa** popover. The preference is persisted. Misspellings are underlined by the OS without disrupting the editor.

### Zen mode (`Cmd+Shift+Z`)

Hides the sidebar, properties panel, and status bar. The editor expands to full width with generous vertical margins. Press `Esc` or `Cmd+Shift+Z` again to exit. Works even when the editor has focus.

### Typewriter mode

Toggle from the status bar (⌨ button). Keeps the active line vertically centred as you type, reducing eye movement during long writing sessions.

### Code blocks

Fenced code blocks are rendered with syntax highlighting via `lowlight`. Highlighting is display-only — the saved markdown is unchanged.

### Image drag-and-drop

Drag one or more image files from Finder (or Explorer) into the editor. Ovid:

1. Copies each image into `<workspace>/assets/` (creating the directory if needed)
2. Inserts a markdown image node at the drop position
3. Shows an inline preview

Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, SVG.

### Link preview

Hover over any link in the editor to see a URL preview tooltip after a short delay.

---

## Properties Panel

The properties panel sits above the editor and displays the frontmatter of the current file.

- **Toggle** — `Cmd+Shift+P` or click the chevron; state is remembered
- **Edit fields** — click any value to edit inline; changes are written back to the frontmatter on disk verbatim
- **Tab between fields** — `Tab` moves to the next field; `Esc` cancels an edit
- **Add fields** — type a new key into the empty field at the bottom
- **Draft badge** — files with `draft: true` show a **DRAFT** badge; click it to toggle

---

## Navigation

### File switcher (`Cmd+P`)

Fuzzy search across all files in the workspace by filename and frontmatter `title`. Keyboard-navigable. Shows the file path for disambiguation.

### Recent files

The last 10 opened files per workspace are tracked and shown at the top of the file switcher and in the empty state.

### Full-text search (`Cmd+Shift+F`)

Replaces the sidebar with a search panel. Queries run in Rust across the entire workspace. Results show the filename and matching line with context; the match is highlighted. Click any result to open the file. Frontmatter content is included in the search.

---

## Save & Status Bar

The status bar (bottom of the window) shows:

- **Filename** of the current file
- **Save indicator** — grey dot = saved, amber dot = unsaved changes
- **Word count** — total words in the current file
- **Session words** — `+N` words added since the file was opened; resets on file switch
- **Aa** — editor settings (font, size, spell check, session goal)
- **⌨** — typewriter mode toggle
- **◎** — zen mode toggle
- **Theme toggle** — moon/sun icon for dark/light mode

### Force save (`Cmd+S`)

Bypasses the 750 ms debounce and saves immediately.

### Session word count goal

Open the **Aa** popover, enter a target word count, and click **Set**. The status bar shows your progress (`+N/GOAL`). The goal resets when you quit the app.

---

## Amytis Integration

### Workspace validation

On open, Ovid checks for `site.config.ts` + `content/`. If found, it is treated as an Amytis workspace and content type templates are enabled. A warning toast is shown for non-Amytis folders (the app still works normally).

### Content type templates

If `site.config.ts` defines content types (e.g. `post`, `page`, `note`), the **New file** dialog offers a type selector. The chosen type pre-fills the frontmatter fields defined for that type.

### Git status

When the workspace is a git repository, per-file status markers appear in the sidebar (`●` modified, `+` untracked, `S` staged). Status refreshes automatically after each save.

### Commit & push (`Cmd+Shift+G`)

Opens the commit dialog. The commit message is pre-filled as `Update: <title>`. Edit the message, optionally enable push, and confirm. Requires `git` on `PATH`.

### Publish flow

In the properties panel, click the **DRAFT** badge to toggle `draft: true/false`. Setting `draft: false` on a file in a git workspace automatically opens the commit dialog pre-filled with `Publish: <title>`.

---

## Dark mode

Follows the system preference by default. Toggle manually with the moon/sun icon in the status bar. The preference is persisted across sessions.

---

## Notifications

Errors and warnings appear as brief toast messages at the bottom centre of the window (visible for 2 seconds). They never block writing.
